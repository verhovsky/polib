This documentation covers the latest release of ``polib``.

``polib`` is a library to manipulate, create, modify gettext files (``.pot``,
``.po`` and ``.mo`` files). You can load existing files, iterate through their
entries, add, modify entries, comments or metadata, etc. or create new ``.po``
files from scratch.

``polib`` supports Python 3.6+.

``polib`` is pretty stable now and is used by many
`opensource projects <http://polib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/projects.html>`_.

polib is completely free and opensource, the license used is
`the MIT license <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.
It was developed back in 2006 by `David Jean Louis <izimobil@gmail.com>`_.

To get up and running quickly, consult the :ref:`quick-start guide
<quickstart>`, which describes all the necessary steps to install and use
``polib``.
For more detailed information about how to install and how to use ``polib``,
