``polib`` is a library to manipulate, create, modify gettext files (``.pot``,
``.po`` and ``.mo`` files). You can load existing files, iterate through their
entries, add, modify entries, comments or metadata, etc. or create new ``.po``
files from scratch.

``polib`` supports Python 3.6+.

``polib`` is pretty stable now and is used by many
